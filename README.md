# TaxWebApp

**Basic Goals:**
* View information from database in easy-to-read tables.
* Can select a row to edit information or add a new row.
* Simple search for names of people

**Things that we might need:**
* A sketch of what some of the pages should look
* Getting a HTML Form that could create a model (maybe a person model) and then upload to DB
  * Off of that idea, being able to edit a model that exists in the DB
* Ideas to put on this list
    
**Things that would be nice to have:**
* Upload Data from an excel file
  * Or at least more Dummy Stuff that is automatically put into the local DB
* API to access stuff
